# Easy_Image_Caption_using_Transformer_Pytorch
New model to achieve the better performance at a low cost.  And I hope it will be a tutorial of image capture because I took really easy steps.



## getting started
This repo is based on many image capture models like 
 * [Show-and-Tell-A-Neural-Image-Caption-Generator](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf), 
 * [Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf), 
 * [Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention for Image Captioning and Visual Question Answering(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07998.pdf),
 * [Meshed-Memory Transformer for Image Captioning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08226.pdf) and so on.
I develpoed the simplest and better performance model.
